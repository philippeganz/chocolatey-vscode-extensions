# Copilot Studio extension for Visual Studio Code

The Copilot Studio extension for Visual Studio Code is designed to enhance the development experience of Microsoft Copilot Studio agents. It provides language support, IntelliSense code completion and suggestions, and authoring capabilities for Copilot Studio agent components.

After installation, the extension prompts you to sign in to Copilot Studio. It can then show you a list of the agents associated with your environment. Clone an agent to see its editable components, including knowledge sources, actions, topics, and triggers.


## Connect to Copilot Studio for the first time

1. Select the Copilot Studio icon in the primary side bar of Visual Studio Code. The extension asks for your permission to sign in.

1. Select **Allow**, and sign in with the appropriate credentials for your Copilot Studio environment.

## Clone an agent

1. (Optional) Open the desired agent in Copilot Studio and copy its URL from your browser's address bar.

1. In the **Copilot Studio** panel of Visual Studio Code, select **Clone agent**.

1. Select your agent (marked with "from clipboard" if you already copied the URL); otherwise, select the desired environment and then select the desired agent. The extension prompts you to select a folder to hold your agent's files (similar to a local repository).

1. Select the desired folder.

## Edit your agent

To edit any component, open the corresponding file and make the desired changes. Since Visual Studio Code natively supports YAML files, the Copilot Studio extension supports IntelliSense code completion and can provide guided tips.

## Sync your changes

The Copilot Studio extension keeps your local workspace in sync with your agent. Use the sync commands in the **Agent Changes** view to manage changes between your local files and your Copilot Studio agent.

- **Preview changes** — See what's different between your local workspace and the agent in Copilot Studio, without modifying any files.
- **Get changes** — Download the latest changes from your Copilot Studio agent into your local workspace.
- **Apply changes** — Upload your local edits to your Copilot Studio agent.

When you apply changes, they are saved directly to your agent's environment. This is a _live editing_ experience—your agent is updated immediately.
